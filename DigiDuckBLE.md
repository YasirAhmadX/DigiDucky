DigiDuckyBLE Sketch uses 5590 bytes (92%) of program storage space. Maximum is 6012 bytes. Global variables use 323 bytes of dynamic memory.
Restricted by this storage space, DigiDucky lacks support of special keystrokes like `LEFT_SHIFT`,`LEFT_ALT`,etc. However one can always customize the available macros
according to their need, right!?  

For development, I used [Serial Bluetooth Terminal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.kai_morich.serial_bluetooth_terminal).  
Exported configuration file for the app is [here](/DigiDuckBLE_terminal_cfg.txt)
